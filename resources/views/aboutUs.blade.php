          Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations throughout India under the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our family has combined their years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other partners working together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.

    <h2 class="section-title" style="color: #5f3dc4;" >Our Moral Responsibility</h2>
    <p class="paragraph highlight-text" style="color: #5f3dc4;" >Food Safety ISO 22000</p>

    <h5 class="highlight-text text-start" style="color:#5f3dc4;">Food Processing Sanitation/Hygiene</h5>
    <p class="paragraph text-start">
      The philosophical viewpoint of the Food and Drug Administration is that they would prefer to see industries fixing their plant sites compliance voluntarily
      rather than to force compliance through FDA action.
      The compliance team helps plant units to operate in a positive visual front making less inspection.
      The cleaner examples are the key criteria for food product processing where empty, well-lighted areas, which gather no dust, lint, or grime,
      are seen as characteristics key to hygiene, indicating that the site did not come from unsanitary conditions.
    </p>

    <h5 class="highlight-text text-start" style="color: #5f3dc4;" >Our standards</h5>
    <p class="paragraph text-start">
      We are an ISO 22000 certified company. We believe in ensuring the highest degree of sanitation and hygiene. We also follow Good Manufacturing practices,
      issued by the FSSAI and FSSC 22000 organizations.
    </p>

    <h5 class="highlight-text text-start" style="color:#5f3dc4;" >Our Values</h5>
    <p class="paragraph text-start">
      Monginis has a moral responsibility of upholding all the Laws related by the FSA. We believe in selling the highest quality of raw materials
      and ingredients in our manufacturing process. We do not compromise with deadlines nor delay any safety checks mandated by regulation.
      All our production is 100% in compliance with Indian food safety standards. We strictly do not allow carriage of food in untreated wooden crates.
      Our company is 100% vegetarian, and we do not use egg in our cakes. All equipment is cleaned and sterilized 10 times a day. We have regular and
      weekly audits that ensure that there is no contamination risk.
    </p>

    <h5 class="highlight-text text-start" style="color: #5f3dc4;">Good Manufacturing Practices</h5>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>We believe good sanitation is our best practice. For we believe that good sanitation will always yield good product results. If the plant is
      unsanitary then it is super difficult to yield a safe product.</li>
      <li>Sanitation guidelines are issued based on manufacturing Practices (GMPs 110.10 Part 110.20; 110.35 Sub Part B).</li>
      <li>All bakeries must follow the FSSAI Act. These guidelines are revised in sync with the Codex Alimentarius by WHO and FAO.</li>
      <li>The chief guideline is adherence to food safety at the food processor must follow:
        <ul>
          <li>Cleanliness of food contact surfaces under the Good Manufacturing Practices.</li>
          <li>Maintenance of hand washing, sanitation, gloves, hairnets, and cleanliness.</li>
          <li>Storage of perishable ingredients and finished products in hygienic, closed, chilled containers. </li>
          <li>Sanitation of floors, ceilings, walls, and equipment with approved cleaners, every day, at key process steps including production floor. </li>
          <li>Food handlers must wear clean protective equipment including gloves and masks. No use of jewelry or personal items is allowed in
          packaging/processing zones.</li>
          <li>Inspection team must ensure there are no sources of microbiological contamination inside the unit such as drains or air vents.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Water used must be purified and fit for food production.</li>
      <li>All raw material used is of FSSAI approved vendors only and nothing is taken outside this list.</li>
      <li>All of our stores must pass local municipal inspections every quarter to retain our license to operate. Food is labeled and
      expiration monitored daily. Damaged goods are removed from shelf immediately.</li>
    </ul>
